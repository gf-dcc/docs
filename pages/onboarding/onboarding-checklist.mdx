    **Onboarding Check List**: 
   
We welcome new teams with an overview that covers the Gray Foundation DCC and what setup is needed. For new staff, who may join a team some time after the project has started, there is [Supplemental Onboarding](#supplemental-onboarding), which is shorter and more flexible.

We give a general overview of the interactions and steps part of the onboarding.
   
## New Teams Initial Onboarding

### New Teams Webinar Hosted by the DCC (Approximately 1 hour)
The objective of this webinar is to: 
- Provide a face-to-face introduction to the DCC staff including Sage Bionetworks and MSKCC
- Review the [Onboarding Checklist](#new-teams-onboarding-checklist)
- Introduce teams to open-science data storage and analysis tools (ie. Synapse and cBioportal)
- Discuss potential data sharing goals and brain storm data-reusability and analysis opportunities
- Inform teams of opportunities to join working groups (i.e. the governance working group) and collaborate with other Gray Foundation researchers

## Supplemental Onboarding

Onboarding is available for new personnel and are designated data lead(s) after a project has been started. 
Please contact the DCC if you As soon as the DCC is aware of the new personnel relevant to the project, we will reach out with onboarding interactions and steps adapted from the above; this can be more flexible because there may already have been some knowledge transfer.
