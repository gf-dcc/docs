### Why should I share data? 

1. Engage and develop connections with the community 
2. Have a remote respository of data for future researchers 
3. Achieve visibility of your research
4. Saves time and advances scientific discovery
5. Many grants and journals now require open-access-data

### Where will my data be stored? 

Data is stored on synapse.org. There, you can organize your data by specific assays.  FOr more info, see [Submitting Data]()

### Should I wait until a paper is published before sharing data? 

You may upload your data and keep it stored privately until your paper is released if that is what you choose to do.  


### What is cBioportal? 

cBioportal is an open-source interactive platform to visualize molecular and clinical attributes. For certain data sets on Synapse, visualization will be available on cBioportal.

### What kind of data should be shared? 

Omics data, imaging data, clinical data, or other types of data that are important to the experiment should be shared along with protocols to replicate those experiments.
If you are unsure, please feel free to contact the DCC.  

### Can I use Synapse/Sage Bionetworks resources to fulfill the NIH data sharing plan requirements? 
Yes, we are happy to help you work on a data sharing plan that will fulfill the NIH requirements.  

### What is a data model?

    > A data model organizes data elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another. 
    It explicitly determines the structure of the data.

### Where does the Gray Foundation data model come from? 

The Gray Foundation’s data model is derived from several data standards such as the [Genomics Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-standards) but has also been adapted to fit the needs of the consortium. 
It outlines, defines, and standardizes how data such as clinical data are represented and how they relate to one another, e.g. a patient has a diagnosis and receives therapy. 
One of the most important relations is of clinical data to generated data -- in Gray Foundation, most generated data are human data and need to be tied to the original patients for useful analysis.  

The section [Clinical Data](/data-model/clinical-data) explains what clinical data are prioritized.
In the data model, attributes are grouped into “components” or “modules”, e.g. patient-related attributes such as `age`, `sex`, etc., are in a patient core component. 
Attributes appear as columnnar fields in a table when collecting data. They may be required or optional and may have controlled terminologies for the values.

### What is metadata?

    > Metadata is additional, standardized information included alongside the data to give it context—data about the data, if you will. 
    Metadata is what allows data in the portal to be searchable, discoverable, accessible, re-usable, and understandable to others, including those who were not involved in the data generation process.
    Metadata can be descriptive (i.e., the name of the file), administrative (i.e., provenance information), or research-based (i.e., information about the sampling and handling of data).
    
    -- [AD Knowledge Portal Glossary](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/spaces/APD/pages/edit-v2/2062254225#Metadata)

Metadata can also be thought of as "data about data", while clinical data can be thought of as "data about patients". 
On the Synapse platform, adding metadata to data entities (files) is most often called "annotating", and metadata is interchangeably called "annotations". 
The [Dataset and File Metadata](/data-model/dataset-file-metadata) section goes into more detail what annotations are expected for datasets and different file types.

### How do I submit an issue regarding the data model?

For questions/discussions, suggestions, and issues (bugs) regarding the data model, it is preferred that members [submit an issue at our source repository](https://github.com/gf-dcc/data-model/issues/new). 
Note that this requires a GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account, please reach out to one our DCC staff listed in [Contacts](#contacts).
