# Data Analysis

The “Analysis Portal” aims to provide the most appropriate analysis and visualization functionality for each data type. 
It can refer to multiple apps/platforms because no one platform supports all data types. 
The team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) develops, adapts, and maintains all the component apps/platforms for the Gray Foundation-generated data.
Below, we describe the ones that will be available for the Gray Foundation consortium and their primary data targets.

## cBioPortal

The [cBioPortal](https://docs.cbioportal.org/) for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) for sharing of **genomics** data. 
For the Gray Foundation-specific instance, the genomics data that will be available are:

- Copy Number Variation (CNV) data
- Gene Expression (RNA-seq)
- Mutations

## CELLxGENE 

[CELLxGENE](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) ("cell-by-gene") is an interactive data explorer for **single-cell datasets**.

It is used for several Gray Foundation scRNA-seq datasets.

## Minerva Viewer

[Minerva](https://www.cycif.org/software/minerva) is an image viewer with multiple layers and interactive zooming/panning.

Gray foundation datasets visualizable through this app:
- t-CyCIF
