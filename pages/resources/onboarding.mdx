# Onboarding Overview

We welcome new teams with a [New Teams Intitial Onboarding](#new-teams-initial-onboarding) that covers the Gray Foundation DCC and what setup is needed. 
For new staff, who may join a team some time after the project has started, there is [Supplemental Onboarding](#supplemental-onboarding), which is shorter and more flexible.

We give a general overview of the interactions and steps part of the onboarding.

## New Teams Initial Onboarding

- Introduce teams to open-science data storage and analysis tools (ie. Synapse and cBioportal)
- Discuss potential data sharing goals and brain storm data-reusability and analysis opportunities
- Inform teams of opportunities to join working groups (i.e. the governance working group) and collaborate with other Gray Foundation researchers
