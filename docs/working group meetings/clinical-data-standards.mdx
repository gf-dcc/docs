# Portal Design Working Group

The focus of the Portal Design Working Group is to collaboratively brainstorm strategies for enhancing data discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. Within this working group, our objectives include improving our existing portal and sharing valuable insights on how data can be effectively repurposed. This may include demonstrating methods for seamlessly transferring data to external analysis tools.
