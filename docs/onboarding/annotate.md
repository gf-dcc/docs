# Applying Metadata to Data


After uploading data, contributors can find those files on our [Data Curator App](https://dca.app.sagebionetworks.org/), which is used to help annotate the data. Select **Gray Foundation**, your project name, and the folder of files you want to annotate. Then select a metadata template.
Click download template and go through the steps of populating the template. Export the template as a .csv and reupload it to the data curator app and validate. After it passes validation, you may submit it and your annotations will now appear on Synapse with your data. 

[Watch this quick video to become familiar on metadata](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuV7s50ck/sKjd9PIPfBNlbHbTlGC15A/watch?utm_content=DAFuV7s50ck&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)

We offer a variety of metadata templates tailored to different data types and assays. 

Here's are examples of the google sheets that are generated for common assays:

- [Imaging Level 2 Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1SoGrRLRmKFUjk4hj4YMJKi-9zeiAKm1XIfqjYa9Q6iA/edit)
- [Patient Data Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mawAq6MiSiGfHa6ezEfCir0MVXZCxd3atZvVgE_ZOiM/edit)
- [Single Cell RNA Sequencing Level 1 Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cpiZn6vnehpYaLoi8ponTrDHxqoGIXXEjXqiWpaHSfg/edit#gid=0)

These templates ensure that your data is well-documented and organized, making it easier for you to manage and share your research.
