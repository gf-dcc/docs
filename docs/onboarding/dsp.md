# Data Sharing Plan

One important component of a data sharing plan is to outline what datasets will be shared. We have a form that collects information focusing on this component. It is not as extensive as a plan described by NIH policies(opens in a new tab), but is nevertheless used for the practical purpose of better data management. By having a record of what to expect, the DCC can better plan storage, new application features, governance, and other infrastructure around the incoming data.

After the onboarding process is completed, the team's PI/data lead will be provided with a distinct link, granting them access to their personalized data sharing plan. This plan will come with essential information already filled in. The DCC Data Manager will be responsible for sending this link whenever updates to the data sharing plan are necessary.
